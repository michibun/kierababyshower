Hi there, please help me recreate the design I made on Canva! You should use "You're Invited!.png" as a reference, and make an exact replica of it design-wise.
All of the images used in the design are available in the repo, saved as pngs with transparent backgrounds. The size of each of these pngs is accurate, and if you follow the reference, you should be able to layer them properly without moving anything. 
Please code this in html. The design is essentially an email newsletter. The size of this design is 794 x 1123 px.
I also need:
  "registry.png" to be clickable and lead to "https://www.myregistry.com/baby-registry/benjamin-ritterbusch-and-kiera-macgregor-ottawa-on/4977990/giftlist".
  "rsvp.png" to be clickable and lead to "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvgTrcZcqP16g5mllyBmunx28QAxOVM2fuUTMeWGlYn_OdCg/viewform?usp=header".
  "addtocalendar.png" to be clickable and lead to "https://calget.com/fcntlsbs"\
Thank you!
